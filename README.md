# Swiggy_data_analysis

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on Swiggy's 2019 dataset. The project aims to identify patterns and insights related to order dynamics, traffic fluctuations, and conversion rates within the Swiggy platform.

Key Features:
1. **Identifying Order Trends:** Utilized excel to identify highs and lows in daily orders relative to the same day of the previous week.
2. **Traffic Analysis:** Investigated changes in traffic sources to pinpoint variations and understand the drivers of traffic changes.
3. **Conversion Rate Analysis:** Examined overall conversion rates and segmented them into Lead to M2C (L2M), M2C to C2P (M2C), C2P to P2O (C2P), and P2O to Order (P2O) metrics.
4. **Enhanced Session Sheet:** Created fresh columns in the Session Sheet to facilitate tracking and evaluation of the identified metrics.

This project provides valuable insights into Swiggy's operational dynamics and user behavior, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and optimize platform performance.

Contributions and feedback are welcomed to enhance the project's effectiveness and applicability in real-world scenarios.
